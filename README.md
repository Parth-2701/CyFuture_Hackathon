# CyFuture_Hackathon
This repository contains the data and code files required for building a Legal Contract Reviewer for english contracts using the CUAD dataset.

## Dataset Used

This project leverages a subset of the **Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD)** to automate legal contract analysis. CUAD is an expert-annotated dataset designed for **high-precision clause extraction**, featuring:

- **500+ contracts**
- **13,000+ labeled clauses**
- **41 specialized legal categories**

By utilizing CUAD, this system enhances efficiency in **contract review and risk assessment**, helping users quickly identify key provisions.
